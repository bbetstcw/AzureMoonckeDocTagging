# Creating or importing a runbook in Azure Automation

You can add a runbook to Azure Automation by either [creating a new one](#creating-a-new-runbook) or by importing an existing runbook from a file or from the [Runbook Gallery](/documentation/articles/automation-runbook-gallery/). This article provides information on creating and importing runbooks from a file.  You can get all of the details on accessing community runbooks and modules in [Runbook and module galleries for Azure Automation](/documentation/articles/automation-runbook-gallery/).

## <a name="ImportRunbook"></a> Importing a runbook from a file into Azure Automation

[AZURE.ACOM]{

You can create a new runbook in Azure Automation by importing a PowerShell script or PowerShell Workflow (.ps1 extension) or an exported graphical runbook (.graphrunbook).  You must specify the [type of runbook](/documentation/articles/automation-runbook-types/) that will be created from the import taking into account the following considerations.

[AZURE.ACOM]}

[AZURE.ACN]{

You can create a new runbook in Azure Automation by importing a PowerShell Workflow (.ps1 extension).


If the file contains multiple PowerShell Workflows, then the import will fail. You must save each workflow to its own file and import each separately.

[AZURE.ACN]}

- [AZURE.ACOM]{
- A .graphrunbook file may only be imported into a new [graphical runbook](/documentation/articles/automation-runbook-types/#graphical-runbooks), and graphical runbooks can only be created from a .graphrunbook file.
- A .ps1 file containing a PowerShell Workflow can only be imported into a [PowerShell Workflow runbook](/documentation/articles/automation-runbook-types/#powershell-workflow-runbooks).  If the file contains multiple PowerShell Workflows, then the import will fail. You must save each workflow to its own file and import each separately.
- A .ps1 file that does not contain a workflow can be imported into either a [PowerShell runbook](/documentation/articles/automation-runbook-types/#powershell-runbooks) or a [PowerShell Workflow runbook](/documentation/articles/automation-runbook-types/#powershell-workflow-runbooks).  If it is imported into a PowerShell Workflow runbook, then it will be converted to a workflow, and comments will be included in the runbook specifying the changes that were made.

### <a name="ImportRunbookScriptPS"></a> To import a runbook from a script file with Windows PowerShell

[AZURE.ACOM]{

You can use the [Import-AzureRMAutomationRunbook](https://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/mt603735.aspx) cmdlet to import a script file as a draft PowerShell Workflow runbook. If the runbook already exists, the import will fail unless you use the *-Force* parameter. 

The following sample commands show how to import a script file into a runbook.

    $automationAccountName =  "AutomationAccount"
    $runbookName = "Sample_TestRunbook"
    $scriptPath = "C:\Runbooks\Sample_TestRunbook.ps1"
    $RGName = "ResourceGroup"
    Import-AzureRMAutomationRunbook -Name $runbookName -Path $scriptPath `
    -ResourceGroupName $RGName -AutomationAccountName $automationAccountName `
    -Type PowerShellWorkflow 

[AZURE.ACOM]}

[AZURE.ACN]{

You can use the [Set-AzureAutomationRunbookDefinition](https://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/dn690267.aspx) cmdlet to import a script file into the Draft version of an existing runbook. The script file must contain a single Windows PowerShell Workflow. If the runbook already has a Draft version, then the import will fail unless you use the Overwrite parameter. After the runbook has been imported, you can publish it with [Publish-AzureAutomationRunbook](https://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/dn690266.aspx).

The following sample commands show how to import a script file into an existing runbook and then publish it.

    $automationAccountName = "AutomationAccount"
    $runbookName = "Sample-TestRunbook"
    $scriptPath = "c:\runbooks\Sample-TestRunbook.ps1"
    Set-AzureAutomationRunbookDefinition -AutomationAccountName $automationAccountName -Name $runbookName -Path $ scriptPath -Overwrite
    Publish-AzureAutomationRunbook -AutomationAccountName $automationAccountName -Name $runbookName

[AZURE.ACN]}


## <a name="publishing-a-runbook"></a> Publishing a runbook

When you create or import a new runbook, you must publish it before you can run it.  Each runbook in Automation has a Draft and a Published version. Only the Published version is available to be run, and only the Draft version can be edited. The Published version is unaffected by any changes to the Draft version. When the Draft version should be made available, then you publish it which overwrites the Published version with the Draft version.

## To publish a runbook using the Azure Classic Management Portal

1. Open the runbook in the Azure Classic Management Portal.
1. At the top of the screen, click **Author**.
1. At the bottom of the screen, click **Publish** and then **Yes** to the verification message.
